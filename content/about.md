# The EZtify Philosophy

We built EZtify because we believe simple digital tasks shouldn't require complex software or trusting your data to a remote server.

Most online tools upload your files to the cloud for processing. This introduces privacy risks, waiting times, and reliance on a stable internet connection.

**We take a different approach.**

## Local-First Architecture

EZtify utilizes cutting-edge web technologies like **WebAssembly (WASM)** and **Service Workers** to bring desktop-class performance to your browser for a wide range of file types.

*   **Zero Uploads:** Your files are processed strictly within your device's memory.
*   **Instant Speed:** By eliminating network latency, operations happen as fast as your CPU allows.
*   **Open Technology:** We rely on trusted open-source libraries to handle PDFs, ZIPs, Code, and more.

Whether you are archiving sensitive financial documents, compressing images, or editing code snippets, EZtify ensures your data remains yours alone.
